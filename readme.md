## DMO Advanced Launcher

Hello! We would like to present to you the custom Digimon Masters Online\* launcher. We invested all our effort and soul into its creation. It doesn't look like a default launcher. It is: beautiful, comfortable, functional.

### Overview and features
**DMO Advanced Launcher** supports ADMO ([Aeria](http://www.aeriagames.com/playnow/dmus/)), GDMO ([GameKing](http://dmo.gameking.com/)), KDMO ([www.digimonmasters.com](www.digimonmasters.com) and [IMBC](http://dm.imbc.com/)) servers. Unfortunately, not all features are supported for all servers. For example, Digimon Rotation and Community pages aren't available for ADMO.
Functionality is distributed into different categories:

- [A] - supported for Aeria mode;
- [G] - supported for GameKing mode;
- [K] - supported for Korean mode (both www.digimonmasters.com and IMBC);
- [S] - supported for any mode.

#### Main features:
- [G|K] Rotation of top Digimons of your guild
- [G|K] Stay Up-to-Date! Getting information about any guild (ranking, reputation, list of tamers, digimons, etc)
- [G] GameKing news
- [S] Community Twitter statuses (@DMOWiki by default or @dmo_russian for Russian users)
- [S] Checking and installing game updates (disabled by default)
- [S] Screenshot gallery
- [S] Let the game meets. Possibility of change some game resources like login background, dialogs, etc.
- [S] Launching the game through AppLocale, NTLEA or Locale Emulator (fixing codepage troubles like bad cyrillic at guild chat)
- [S] Profile system. You can make many profiles for every server/account/etc.

Note: GameKing DigiRotation and Community pages are temporary unavailable (GameKing still not provide digimon/guild ranking pages).

### System Requirements
- Windows Vista SP2 / Windows 7 SP1 / Windows 8 / Windows 8.1 / Windows 10
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5

### Help with Translations
We will be happy to get your help with translation the launcher into other languages. Look at the [Languages](https://github.com/GoldRenard/DMOAdvancedLauncher/tree/master/AdvancedLauncher/Languages) folder of root launcher's folder. Use [Template_for_translation.txt](https://github.com/GoldRenard/DMOAdvancedLauncher/blob/master/AdvancedLauncher/Languages/Template_for_translation.txt) as template. Also you can correct our English translation. I know that current is bad xD
Please [send an email](mailto:goldrenard@gmail.com) with your translations.

### Known issues
- Community page and DigiRotation uses information of game website. You know, not all digimons are provided at ranking or tamer's information pages (especially at ~~Failmax~~Joymax). So not all digimons provided at our launcher.
- Moreover, launcher can get only ONE digimon of ONE type from website. So if you have two Impmons then only ONE will be added to database of launcher. Usually it's a latest hatched Digimon.
- Long logon process for KDMO IMBC. Error 705 is ok, you should just wait for successful login. If you're getting error 705 10 or more times, check your account data.

## Changelog (Version 3.3.180 hotfix)

 - UI performance improvements
 - Fixed an app crash caused by *.ico compression
 - News date/time format has been fixed
 - Manual authentication support (Aeria only)
 - Some internal improvements (bugreport functional, repository structure, etc)

##### Patch note:
If you have any issues with Aeria login (like WRONG_PAGE errors), you can try following:

1. Try to use your email instead of login name
2. If it doesn't help, try to enable "Manual authentication" option in profile settings. This will redirect you to native Aeria login page just like original launcher.
