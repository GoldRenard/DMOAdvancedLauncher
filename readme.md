### Overview and features
**DMO Advanced Launcher** supports ADMO ([Aeria](http://www.aeriagames.com/playnow/dmus/)), GDMO ([Joymax](http://www.joymax.com/dmo/)), KDMO ([www.digimonmasters.com](www.digimonmasters.com) and [IMBC](http://dm.imbc.com/)) servers.

### Help with Translations
We will be happy to get your help with translation the launcher into other languages. Look at the [Languages](https://github.com/GoldRenard/DMOAdvancedLauncher/tree/master/AdvancedLauncher/Languages) folder of root launcher's folder. Use [Template_for_translation.txt](https://github.com/GoldRenard/DMOAdvancedLauncher/blob/master/AdvancedLauncher/Languages/Template_for_translation.txt) as template. Also you can correct my English translation. I know that current is bad xD
Please [send an email](mailto:goldrenard@gmail.com) with your translations.

### Known issues
- Community page and DigiRotation uses information of game website. You know, not all digimons are provided at ranking or tamer's information pages (especially at ~~Failmax~~Joymax). So not all digimons provided at our launcher.
- Moreover, launcher can get only ONE digimon of ONE type from website. So if you have two Impmons then only ONE will be added to database of launcher. Usually it's a latest hatched Digimon.
- Long logon process for KDMO IMBC. Error 705 is ok, you should just wait for successful login. If you're getting error 705 10 or more times, check your account data.
